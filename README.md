## Project Description

A new, unsigned music artist desires to uncover what similarities exist between music releases from various genres in terms of their lyrical content. Specifically, he would like to know if the genre of a piece of music can be predicted by its lyrical content. Accordingly, these results would guide him regarding what lyrical themes and topics are prevalent in various kinds of music. Through using Multinomial Naive Bayes and KNN Classifier models, we attempted to see how well we could predict release genres by lyrics for a set of webscraped musical releases from Bandcamp, an online independent music distribution platform.
This project is of significance primarily for unsigned independent artists who are interested in self-releasing their music online and music researchers who want to learn more about larger cultural themes that emerge through linguistic analysis of contemporary, independently released music.
